Access natas5 lab using http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/

Visiting webpage shows "Access disallowed, You are not logged in."

So as usaual i've checked page source code found nothing, also tried robots.txt no file found then tried to add referer in request headers but no success
then i checked the storage option in developer tab there i found a cookie named logged in set to 0, changed it to 1 and refreshed the browser. 
And thats it.
