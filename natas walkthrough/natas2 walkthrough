Access natas2 challenge using http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/

Following is the result after visiting webpage


As usual i inspected the view-source code but found no password in html comment tag. I was expecting it again :)
I have also checked network tab and all other tabs in developer option but found nothing.
And i was only looking for a long text in page source code and ignored other valuable details like:
there was a image tag importing a image 

<img src="/files/pixel.png"/>

I completely ignored this finding as it provides a valuable directory structure of stored files or images

So i browsed to the url/files/pixel.png and thought that there could be password inside a image but it wasn't there actually a image was of size 1 x 1 not even visible without microscope
after that i tried url/files and ther i found two files first our image and then second a users.txt
After seeing url/files/users.txt i have found a passwords for 6 users and one of them was natas3.
