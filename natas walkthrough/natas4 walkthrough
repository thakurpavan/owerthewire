After visiting natas4 and viewing page source code i found out this:-

<html>
<head>
<!-- This stuff in the header has nothing to do with the level -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/css/level.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/css/jquery-ui.css" />

<script>var wechallinfo = { "level": "natas4", "pass": "QryZXc2e0zahULdHrtHxzyYkj59kUxLQ" };</script></head>
<body>

<div id="content">

This same scenario was in bandit challenge 5.

So as it says we need to come from level 5 challenge here so let's check out level 5 
I tried to login using level 4 password but its a invalid password. 

So now what let's go for walkthrough and I found this explaination by mayadevbe.me
"The communication between the client (our machine) and the server (that hosts the website) is done by a request-response. 
We sent a request for a certain page and the server sends the response with the content. Generally, they will follow different protocols and structures, 
which depend on the service. In this case, it is HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). The request generally includes the request method (GET, POST,…), the requested URL and the protocol version. 
However, it can also include additional, potentially needed information, through so-called request headers. There are many such fields, some more common than others. 
Relevant ones for this challenge are ‘Authorization’, which would include the credentials for the website and ‘Referer’, which is the URL/webpage from which the request is sent. 
Generally, all this is handled by our browser and we do not have to worry about it. It is however possible to manipulate requests.
Here is an example of an HTTP request of my blog that can be sent on the command line with curl:
curl "https://mayadevbe.me/" --compressed -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:131.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/131.0" -H "Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/png,image/svg+xml,*/*;q=0.8" -H "Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5" -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br, zstd" purecookieDismiss=1"
Every header is added in the same form: -H "Header-Name: Header-Value". The ‘User-Agent’ header shows information about the browser, and the ‘Accept’ header shows information about accepted response file types. The ‘purecookieDismiss’ is a header I programmed for this website.
If this would be sent over the command line, the response would be an HTML file/text.
There are many resources online, to read up on HTTP and its headers, for example Mozillas Developer Docs."

I hope you have understand it but it was hard for me, so I just focused on the word "Referer". 
And searched on google for what it does and found a simple explaination on it 

{The "Referer" in the network tab of the developer tools is an HTTP header that indicates the URL of the web page from which a request originated. 
It helps servers identify where users are coming from when they click links to access resources.}

you can also refer to  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Referer for better explaination:


curl 'http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php'   --compressed   -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:140.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/140.0'  
-H 'Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8'   -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5'   -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate'  
-H 'Referer: http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/'   -H 'DNT: 1'   -H 'Authorization: Basic bmF0YXM0OlFyeVpYYzJlMHphaFVMZEhydEh4enlZa2o1OWtVeExR' 
-H 'Connection: keep-alive'   -H 'Cookie: _ga_RD0K2239G0=GS2.1.s1766679427$o3$g1$t1766681451$j53$l0$h0; _ga=GA1.1.527516302.1766654266'   -H 'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1'   -H 'Priority: Du=0, i'

Using above curl command to change referer I found below html code
