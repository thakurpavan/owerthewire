This challenge is accessiable using following link: http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/

Let's Start 

As always the webpage was loaded and there was this 

I tried to inspect view-source code but found nothing like html comment with password or a directory hint like in previous one,
but instead found this comment <!-- No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time... -->

If you are smart enough you will have already got the hint but i didn't understand it at first glance so i went for walkthrough 
and there i found that we need to look into robots.txt 

Actually i know what robots.txt does but I haven't thought about it, that's why in hacking it all about out of the box thinking. 
Here what it does if you don't know you can set allow and disallow values for crawlers so they can know which pages are authorized to crawl.

So Here's what I found in robots.txt. The /s3cr3t/ url was disallowed.

User-agent: *
Disallow: /s3cr3t/

So now I searched for "http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/s3cr3t/" and found index of /s3cr3t where users.txt file was waiting to be found out.

And there you go, you are just one step away to have a password for next level. Go find out!!!
